Welcome to the CSC430 Software Architecture Lab Solutions repository!
This repository contains solutions to the lab exercises for the CSC430 course on Software Architecture.

You will find the solution for each lab in it's corresponding folder

if you'd like you can click on the "<> Code" button and download the project as zip or follow the instructions to clone the repository

I split each exercise of each lab (except lab 1) to a separate commit If you'd like to review a specific exercise alone on github, just click on the n commits button

Note that this repository will be deleted after the course is done and I will not push any solutions unless we finish them in class

Good Luck!
